Chicago's night is as bright as day for the Outfit's Casino. The place in Little Italy was crowded, not for only for its games, but also for its Liquor and Whisky. The Prohibition was the opportunity for business men like the ones at the Outfit to make some profits.
Marzia was inside the casino, sit by the bar but not drinking, she was working. Her late husband Ermilio, a hired gun for the Outfit who never knew fame due his professionalism, felt dead after an ambush some years ago. The Outfit would take care of its women and give her a new position, but being a a brothel wasn't on her plans and she decided to follow her husband steps. Now she was one of the guards watching over the casino.
Suddenly, there was gun-firing and a desperate crowd running everywhere. The casino was being robbed! The five men were from Bugs Moran or Hymie Weiss for sure, shooting their way out, gunning three guards by the casino entrance and more some outside. Their leaving was followed by a big fire by the entrance and the scent of burned gasoline filled the air. She was standing there, his revolver out of bullets, but a Tommy Gun was just on the floor, by a dead family bodyguard. She was not letting those men escape. Not on her watch.
