Marzia is the widow of the late Chicago Outfit's assassin Ermilio. She learned the trade of hired gun with his husband and decided to follow his footsteps.
When a Outfit officer, even tough she had passed the age of 30, offered her a job at one of the Little Italy Brothels as a way to be "protected" inside a family business and "keep herself busy", she asked for occupying his husband position. She was not fit for a whore job. The officer gave her the chance to prove herself, despite the sexist nature of the Outfit. He hoped she was to get scared of the job after some shoot downs. But she never gave up, though she had to face the violence of her new job and her companions laughing of her trying to act like a man.
