	We have a concept!
	==================
This is a great day for our team! Firstly because we are now aligning our first big meeting as a team, and also because we got from our contracted artist and my friend the concept for the main character! I think it is great and I hope it motivates our team to work harder!
By the way, I will take the time to translate some of the archives here, as all team members now are from Brazil, more precisely from Rio de Janeiro, so having the documentation in Portuguese will be handy.
