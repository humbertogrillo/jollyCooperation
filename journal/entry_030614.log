	The more, the jollier!
	======================
Yesterday I started to talk about the Jolly Cooperation project on a message board from IGDA Rio de Janeiro. The aim was to tell people what is happening and ask if there are any more joyful hearths out there with the passion for games and that want to be part of this project.
So far, I got some messages and I am very proud as how people have been reaching us with support and enthusiasm. Some also want to help anyway they can, by testing the games we are making or being part of the team. We would appreciate if there were donations of any kind, we are accepting cookies and coffee if you will! Never mind.
Now we have two more enthusiasts into our little group. Diego is a Publicity professional who learned a few things while playing with developing tools, besides being into music, and Cristiano is as Programmer Analyst as myself, who makes games as a hobby and knows his way with Unity 3D. Both great acquisitions!
Keep in touch!
