	Some small decisions
	====================
We had a little meeting yesterday and decided on the main character layout. I've informed Fernanda Nia to keep working on the character and did some experiments over character design myself. The pixel art version of the easy money enemy was nice, but it turned out too small. Maybe using a limit of 32 pixel high was to little. With this update I present the first view of the main character. Hope you enjoy it!
