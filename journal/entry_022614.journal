	Some ambiguous facts
	====================
When deciding over the games theme, we talked about it being a serious one, despite the humorous nature of the involved members. It is a challenge by itself making a game, but it is a harder challenge for us to make it serious, yet fun.
When the theme came around gangsters, We thought about Chicago's famous mobsters as Al Capone and the sort, thinking back at 20's. I wrote rapidly with the help of Coldye some enemies concept, prior looking into some resources regarding historical events.
Just today I decided to refine background for the games story when I came with a revelation, Molotov Cocktail was not used until Spanish Civil War on late 30's. Was I not to use Molotov Cocktail due to 15 years discrepancy? What else would I have to go without for veracity's sake? Chinese Mafia?
In time, the incendiary guy will have to be redesigned.
