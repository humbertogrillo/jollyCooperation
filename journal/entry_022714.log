	First view on the Protagonist
	=============================
I gave Fernanda Nia (from www.fernandania.com and comoeurealmente.com) the mission to come with an idea for the main character and, oh, boy, she did an amazing job trying to capture the essence of the character and put it into a image. Almost brought tears of joy to my eyes.
Next step is to pixelate the art she made and try not to look crappy. Not an easy task, given the comparison. No, I will not show the world her sketch. Not just yet. But wait until you can see it!
