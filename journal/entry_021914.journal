	First update of the game project itself! Hip Hip Hippopotamus!
	==============================================================
We did a lot of talking e too little of action. We decided to work with a simple platform game like the ones of NES featuring Chicago of the 20's. Some noir, some shooting and a not sexualized protagonist woman, thanks to some input of my feminist sister-in-law. For this first one, we are using Construct 2, for witch I already have a key, and will help us keep on focus while using little to none programming skills.
Coldye and Raghtshade are away doing their own business while studying some basic tools for our project. I am working with a friend, Fernanda Nia, who is a talented illustrator, to come with some basic concepts for the characters. I would like to make some retro looking graphics for the game, so I decided for a 32x32px grid for each character, only the biggest ones occupying that much. the main character and other average characters are going to be 24px high, tying not to deform too much body proportion. We'll be using a folder here for the concept art so anyone may opine.
Stay tuned!
