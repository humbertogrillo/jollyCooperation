	A little about the project itself
	=================================
It was a long time ago when I decided that I would like to make games. It was about the time between when I decided to be a cowboy and when I decided to be an Astronaut, but it was then that the first glare of something of the sort came to my mind.
I'll fast-forward to more a more recent date, when I was studying to became a System Analyst. I decided to make the plan of working with video-games work. I built a 4 steps plan to make it work, based on a post I saw that now I don't now from whom it was.
Those are "Take on small projects", "Invest, study and work harder", "Do something productive with it" and lastly "Be the game developer your child self would be proud of". The first step "Take on small projects" is all about experimentation, making games already made, with little or no complexity, and have fun while doing it. The aim was to forget about dream projects and work on very basic games that could be done with little effort and not compromising other activities.
This step was important so the team could work on the team itself. We needed to check if the team was able to work along prior taking on big projects. We will talk about the other steps and the big plan latter.
Jolly Cooperation is the first time ever I am trying my plan out. I called some friends that played the same games I did and had something in common. I told them about the big plan and that's how Matheus "Raghtshade" and Diogo "Coldye" came into the scheme. We had a few meetings by now and started working on (more like "Talked about") a game project we came with during one of those meetings.
Stay tuned for more updates here at our GIT. More drama, adventures and joyful moments awaits!
